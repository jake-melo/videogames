# pygame_components

## This project would like to create a series of modules that let's you build up quickly a game with pygame. There will be modules, examples and easy to adapt pieces of code.

*Index*

- movements of a rectangle
- movement of a surface


### pygame_entry.py
>Example of an entry widget with pygame. It uses asyncio to use this file in a browser with pygbag. Install pygbag with pip install pygbag.  
>Then call this file main.py, go in the folder that contains the folder (es. 'game')that contains main.py and with cmd execute the command 'pygbag game'  
>You will find a buil directory in game. Into this build folder you find a web folder with the file to upload to your site (or itch.io, or github repo like for example formazione.github.io/...) 
>to make it playable for everyone without installation of anything into the browser with the same frame rate you would have in a window of the os.
